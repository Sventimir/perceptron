# Perceptron

This is a Haskell reproduction of the
[Perceptron](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&v=6xUdENYln-A&redir_token=f6d4oyncpHe63k7iuqJx5BBmdoR8MTU3NDg3NTg1MUAxNTc0Nzg5NDUx&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fopen%3Fid%3D1qOlw-_PK4YTJ70AMLP7OK0wIKa1Jisw0)
program written by [Gupia Nauka](https://www.facebook.com/Gupia-Nauka-170885267179525/).
It's purpose is to demonstrate a simple AI training algorithm.

Results yielded by this program match exactly those of the original program
as of version 1.0.0 (see tag `1.0.0`). This is going to be extended further
with additional features and options, introduction of which may break said
compatibility at some point.

The original Perceptron (written by Gupia Nauka in C++) is attached as a
reference (see `reference/perceptron.cpp`). Training data (also prepared by
Gupia Nauka) is in `data/`. Paths are (so far) hard-coded in the program.
