# Perceptron

This is a Haskell port of the Perceptron program written by
[Głupia Nauka](https://www.facebook.com/Gupia-Nauka-170885267179525/).
It's purpose is to demonstrate a simple AI training algorithm.

The original Perceptron (written by Głupia Nauka in C++) is attached as a
reference (see `reference/perceptron.cpp`). Training data (also prepared by
Głupia Nauka) are in `data/` (paths are hard-coded in the program).
